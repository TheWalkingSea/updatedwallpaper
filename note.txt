This was a project I made in my first year of programming and was one of my major projects for a few months. For context, this was part of a larger business competition going on at school where we had to present a product in which mine was canvlist whose goal was to set the wallpaper of your devices in sync with your Canvas todo list. It was fully customizable to your likings. I ended up getting 1st place at the competition and got a $3,000 grant which I spent on a server.
